Read The Docs documentation for Henry
======================================

This repository is generated into Read The Docs documentation at https://henrydocs.readthedocs.io.

Contributing
------------

Add any new documentation pages to ``docs/sources/`` in `ReST format (.rst)<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`,
and add the name of page to the table of contents at ``docs/sources/index.rst``.
Readthedocs handles the rest, rebuilding the page when changes are pushed here.

Note that the documentation is public! Do not store sensitive information here.
